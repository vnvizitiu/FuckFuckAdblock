FuckFuckAdblock
===============

A simple userscript that acts like FuckAdBlock.js (A well known adblock detector) but always says that no adblock was detected. Just install it using [Tampermonkey][tampermonkey] (chrome) or [Greasemonkey][greasemonkey] (Firefox) by clicking [here][raw] and try it out at http://sitexw.fr/fuckadblock/. FuckFuckAdBlock works on any version of FuckAdBlock. [It's kinda like a trace buster buster][tracebusterbuster]

## This script will only counter FuckAdBlock.js and is not a general purpose anti-anti-adblocker
